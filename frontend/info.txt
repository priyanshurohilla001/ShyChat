🎯 **PeerSpace Design System - Complete Brief**

## 📝 **Project Overview**
**PeerSpace** is a fast, anonymous, peer-to-peer video platform made for students inside a campus LAN. Dark-mode by default, with a sleek, privacy-first design that feels minimal, confident, and technically polished. Target audience: college students (specifically IIIT Kota). The app should feel personal, mysterious, welcoming, and ephemeral - NOT like a social media clone.

## 🎨 **Design Philosophy**
- **Less is more**: Bold typography, minimal classes, maximum impact
- **Student-friendly**: Catch attention without being too professional
- **Techy vibe**: Modern tech website aesthetic with big words and clean elements
- **Consistent**: Use shadcn heavily with minimal custom styling
- **Maintainable**: Write clean, efficient code with minimal class usage

## 🎯 **Core Components**

### **Logo Component** (`/components/ui/logo.tsx`)
```tsx
<Logo size="sm|md|lg" className="mx-auto" />
```
- Reusable across app (navigation, loading, hero)
- Three sizes: sm (w-8 h-8), md (w-16 h-16), lg (w-24 h-24)
- Primary colored rounded square with animated pulse dot

### **AnimatedBackground Component** (`/components/ui/animated-background.tsx`)
```tsx
<AnimatedBackground />
<AnimatedBackground className="opacity-5" /> // For busy screens
```
- Grid pattern representing campus LAN network
- Glowing nodes = active peers ready to connect
- Animated connection lines = peer-to-peer links forming
- 60px spacing for modern, spacious feel

## 🔤 **Typography System**
- **Headings/Brand**: Space Grotesk (font-display) - techy, bold feel
- **Body/UI**: Inter (default sans) - clean, readable
- **Hero text**: `text-7xl` for maximum impact
- **Hierarchy**: Large brand → descriptive copy → single CTA → subtle details

## 🎨 **Color & Theme**
- **Default**: Dark theme (swapped CSS variables in `:root`)
- **Toggle**: Light theme available via `.light` class
- **Colors**: Use shadcn theme tokens only (primary, muted-foreground, etc.)
- **No custom colors**: Maintains consistency across components

## 📱 **Layout Principles**
- **Centered layouts**: Single-column focus with generous whitespace
- **Mobile-first**: Simple responsive with padding adjustments
- **Full-screen**: Each screen takes full viewport height
- **Minimal navigation**: No headers/navs, state-driven screen switching

## 🗣️ **Brand Voice & Copy**
- **Tone**: Casual but confident, slightly sarcastic about college infrastructure
- **Key messaging**:
  - "Meet random people in your institute. No profiles, no history, just pure conversation."
  - "An Institute of National Importance" - connecting students when WiFi permits
- **Privacy focus**: Anonymous, ephemeral, local-only connections
- **Technical emphasis**: Peer-to-peer, WebRTC powered, campus LAN

## 🛠️ **Technical Stack**
- **Framework**: React + Vite + TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS v4 + shadcn/ui components
- **Fonts**: Inter + Space Grotesk via Google Fonts CDN
- **Theme**: Custom CSS variables with dark/light switching
- **Icons**: Lucide React
- **State**: Hook-based with Context providers

### **Writing Guidelines**
- **Keep it short**: 1-2 lines max, punchy delivery
- **Tech confidence**: Sound like you know what you're doing
- **College context**: Reference campus life without being cringe
- **Emoji sparingly**: 1 per message, choose wisely
- **No corporate speak**: Avoid "We apologize for the inconvenience"
- **Personality over perfection**: Slight sarcasm beats bland politeness

This system creates a **consistent, maintainable, and engaging** design that resonates with college students while maintaining technical credibility and privacy focus.
